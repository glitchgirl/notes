An Overview of Computers and Programming
- Computer systems
    - Hardware
    - Software
        - Application 
        - System
        - We use software too:
            - get input
            - process
            - give output
        - written in a programming language
            - all languages have syntax
            - human readable vs machine language
            - scripting vs non-scripting
    - Memory 
        - volatile vs non-volatile

- Simple program logic
    - 
- The steps involved in the program development cycle
    - this is NOT referring to "the development cycle" like scrum or whatever
    - 7 steps
        1. understand the problem
            - users
            - asking questions
            - edge cases
            - documentation 
        2. Plan the logic
            - algorithm
            - IPO chart
            - TOE chart
        3. code the program
        4. use a software to translate to machine language
        5. test
        6. put into prod
        7. maintain
    - tbh I disagree with this, but its not a bad start. I would add more testing, and steps 6 and 7 are not really helpful until you actually start working. (i.e. these are devops steps, not developer steps)
- Psuedocode statements and flowchart symbols
    - this book uses a rhombus for input and output and a rectangle for processing
    - it uses an oval for start and stop, and regular arrows for movement
    - diamonds for decisions
    - marks in rectangles for internal/external calls
    - loops
- Using a sentinel value to end a program
- Programming and user environments
- The evolution of programming models
    - why we starting at the 40s, lets talk about fun things like jacards loom!! 
    - Okay I take it back, they have a note about ada and turing. I feel better.
    - procedural programming (is this functional programming?)
    - NO - Procedural programming uses a very detailed list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step. This approach uses iteration to repeat a series of steps as often as needed. Functional programming is an approach to problem solving that treats every computation as a mathematical function.
    - OOP
