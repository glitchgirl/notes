Understanding Structure
- The disadvantages of unstructured spaghetti code (yummy)
    - hard to follow, hard to build off of, hard to share with another person
- the three basic structures - sequence, selections, and loop
    - sequence (driving instructions)
    - selection (make a choice)
        - if, else and all the combinations between those
    - loop
        - while, do while, 
    - can combine structures (i.e. while dirty dishes, clean dishes (if delicate handwash, else dishwasher))
- using a priming input to structure a program
- the need for structure
- recognizing structure
- structuring and modularizing unstructured logic
