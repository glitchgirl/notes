# Azure overview

Application hosting on Azure - Azure can host your entire application stack from web applications and APIs to databases to storage services. Azure supports a variety of hosting models from fully managed services to containers to virtual machines. When using fully managed Azure services, your applications can take advantage of the scalability, high-availability, and security built in to Azure.

Consuming cloud services from existing on-premises applications - Existing on-premises apps can incorporate Azure services to extend their capabilities. For example, an application could use Azure Blob Storage to store files in the cloud, Azure Key Vault to securely store application secrets, or Azure Cognitive Search to add full-text search capability. These services are fully managed by Azure and can be easily added to your existing apps without changing your current application architecture or deployment model.

Container based architectures - Azure provides a variety of container based services to support your app modernization journey. Whether you need a private registry for your container images, are containerizing an existing app for ease of deployment, deploying microservices based applications, or managing containers at scale, Azure has solutions that support your needs.

Modern serverless architectures - Azure Functions simplify building solutions to handle event-driven workflows, whether responding to HTTP requests, handling file uploads in Blob storage, or processing events in a queue. You write only the code necessary to handle your event without worrying about servers or framework code. Further, you can take advantage of over 250 connectors to other Azure and third-party services to tackle your toughest integration problems.


# App Service overview

Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Node.js, PHP, and Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

App Service adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. Additionally, you can take advantage of its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.
