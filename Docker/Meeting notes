Docker

- we use it instead of a million vmware instances
- there is a really nice graph that explains how all the pieces talk to each other
- remember, inside the container the memory is voliate, so create a seperate db for database
- orbstack versus desktop
- octane uses github actions and runners, to handle the updates
- because runners are shared, sometimes you can run into issues. mostly these can be fixed with waiting and re-running
