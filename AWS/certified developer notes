General notes: 
- read the test carefully (lots of select twos/ NOTS)
- look for keywords: server, client, backend, cache, frontend, ELB, ALB, NLB

Knowledge notes:

- User Data is used to perform common automated config tasks and run scripts after the instance starts. Can pass two types of data, shell scripts and cloud-init directives as either plain text or file. 
- SSE-C is server side encrpytion with customer provided keys
- ALBs distribute traffic across multiple targets in multiple AZ. 
- To use an HTTPS listener you must deploy at least one SSL/TLS cert on LB. As the instances behind the ALB are under heavy load, the LB will use the server cert to teminate the front-end connection and then decrypt requests before sending them to the instances.
- Read capacity units (one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second, for an item up to 4KB in size) 
- Write capacity units (one write per second for an item up to 1KB in size) ((items rounded up))
- ECS - elastic container service (docker(and friends) management) 
- Max AWS KMS size is 4KB
- CloudFormation key words:
  - !ImportValue = returns value of an output from another stack
  - !Ref = returns value of a parameter or resource
  - !GetAtt = returns the value of an attribute from a resource in the template
  - !Sub = substitutes variables
 - SQS uses a visibility timeout to prevent other consumers from receiving and processing the same message

  Test review notes:
  Reducing latency with DynamoDB / OLTP should be done with global tables (if global users), and use eventually consistent reads instead of strongly consistent reads
  DAX is for read heavy, not write heavy. 
  User data features - run during boot cycle when first launched, and are executed with root user priv. 
  Pass through doesn't terminate instances/connections so it doesn't reduce load. 
  cloudformation reference = !ref 
  access key id / secret key only used by AWS CLI, other services use commands like get-login
