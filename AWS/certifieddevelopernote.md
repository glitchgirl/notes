General notes: 
- read the test carefully (lots of select twos/ NOTS)
- look for keywords: server, client, backend, cache, frontend, ELB, ALB, NLB

Knowledge notes:

 - User Data is used to perform common automated config tasks and run scripts after the instance starts. Can pass two types of data, shell scripts and cloud-init directives as either plain text or file. 
 - SSE-C is server side encrpytion with customer provided keys
 - ALBs distribute traffic across multiple targets in multiple AZ. 
 - To use an HTTPS listener you must deploy at least one SSL/TLS cert on LB. As the instances behind the ALB are under heavy load, the LB will use the server cert to teminate the front-end connection and then decrypt requests before sending them to the instances.
 - Read capacity units (one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second, for an item up to 4KB in size) 
 - Write capacity units (one write per second for an item up to 1KB in size) ((items rounded up))
 - ECS - elastic container service (docker(and friends) management) 
 - Max AWS KMS size is 4KB
 - CloudFormation key words:
   - !ImportValue = returns value of an output from another stack
   - !Ref = returns value of a parameter or resource
   - !GetAtt = returns the value of an attribute from a resource in the template
   - !Sub = substitutes variables
  - SQS uses a visibility timeout to prevent other consumers from receiving and processing the same message
  - ARN (amazon resource Name)
  - code commit - like github but its HIPPA compliant
  - Amazon certification manage - manages ssl/tls
  - Code development kit - infrastrucutre as code with imperative paradim 
  - secrets managener - used for automatically rotating database creds
  - ssm parameter - data mangement

  Test review notes:
 - Reducing latency with DynamoDB / OLTP should be done with global tables (if global users), and use eventually consistent reads instead of strongly consistent reads
 - DAX is for read heavy, not write heavy. 
 - User data features - run during boot cycle when first launched, and are executed with root user priv. 
 - Pass through doesn't terminate instances/connections so it doesn't reduce load. 
 - cloudformation reference = !ref 
 - access key id / secret key only used by AWS CLI, other services use commands like get-login
  - members will be able to see the organixation trail but cannot modify or delete it
  - auto scaling cannot add a volume to an existin ginstance if the existing volume is approaching capacity
  - SWF ensures the task is assigned only once while sqs may deliver the message multiple times
  
  Youtube video Review notes Video 1 :
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrKRN9zRBWs
 - Elastic Beanstalk
    - PaaS - platform as a service (not recommended for large production loads)
    - Powered by cloudformation 
    - EC2 instance preconfig
    - in place and blue/green
    - dockerized env
    - supported langs: ruby, python, php, tomcat, nodejs 
    - eb it's self is free, but services cost money
    - don't need to worry about underlying infrastructure
  - Deployment Policies
    - All at once
     - fastest dangerous
     - deploy new app to all instances, out of service while deploying, comes up with new stuff
    - Rolling 
     - deploys new app a few at a time, takes a batch out, reattaches 
    - Rolling with additional batch
     - spin up new service, with new app, kill old apps
     - never has reduced capacity
    - Immutable
     - safest, might be expensive
     - new asg, deploy the updated version of the app to new EC2, point the ELB to the new ASG, then term the old one
 - Web vs Worker
  - web(load balanced env): 
    - creates an ASG (auto scaling group)
    - creates and ELB (elastic load balancer)
    - designed to scale
  - Single Instance Env
    - uses an ASg set to one, no ELB, public IP
    - cannot do rolling / rolling with batch deployments
  - Worker:
   - creates ASG
   - SQS
   - Sqsd daemon on EC2
   - Creates cloudwatch alarms
  - Configuration files
   - options, server config(can put commands that run before setup here), custom resources
   - .ebextensions
   - .config
  - Environment manifest
   - env.yml
  - CLI 
   - eb init (sets up default)
   - eb create first env
   - status, health, events, logs, config, deploy, terminate
   - eb open opens in browser
 - Custom images
  - you can specify an AMI instead of the standard
  - describe-platform-version
- Database
  - inside 
   - generally for dev
   - when EB env is terminated the db will also be terminated 
  - outside
   - for prod
   - RDS sep from EB
   - when EB env is terminated, db will remain
    
- Fargate
 - can create empty ECS(elastic container service) cluster, then launch task as fargat
 - don't have to provison containers
 - define memory and vCPU
 - add containers and allocate memory and vCPU
 - choose VPC and submet
 - apply security group, IAM to TASK 
 - cold start
 - runs as long as you want
 - up to 30GB of memory
 - provide your own containers
 - more manual labour
 
- X-Ray
 - What is mirco-service architecture? - ach/org approach to soft dev where softwarte is composed of small independent service that communicate over well defined APIs
 - What is distributed tracing? method used to rpfoile and monitor apps, especially those with microservices, pinpoints failures and what causes poor performance.
 - not exactly performance monitoring, but falls under that umbrella 
 - console has visualization 
 - api is behind a daemon
 - there are x-ray sdks for language - interceptors, client handlers, http client
 - aws sdk and cli
 - Instrumenting - ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance, errors, and to write trace information
 - Daemon makes JSON segment documents to the process / queue - acts as a buffer for the api
 - it's installed already on serverless (lambda elastic beanstalk)
 - Concepts
  - segemnts = data from services, contains host, request, response, the work done, issues that occur
  - subsegments = granular timing information and details about downstream calls that your app made to fulfill the original request. additonal details too. Need to include sdk
  - traces = groups segments that have a common request, adds a trace id header
  - sampling = doesn't store every trace, this keeps the cost low.
  - filter expressions = narrow down specific paths/users 
  - groups = assign filter expression to a group so its gets its own service graph, trace, and cloudwatch. if you update the group, it won't retro the data

  - Annotations and Metadata - adds to the segment document 
    - ann = indexed, key-value, up to 50
    - key = UNIDEXED, key value, no limit
  - service graph = the client, front-end, and backend services helps with bottlenecks/lactency/errors
    
 ACM 
 - amazon cert manager
 - ssl/tls
 - public, private (400 a month)
 - multiple subdomains, *
 - terminating ssl at LB
 - ssl end to end, complicated, but better 
 
 Route 53
 - DNS
 - Record sets domains/subdomains
 - Alias lets us select direct aws resources instead of ips
 - routing policies (versioning)
   - simple
    - default
    - 1 record, multiple IP
    - random
   - weighted
    - splits up traffic based on different weights
    - good for testing featurs
   - latency based 
    - lowest network latency for your end user
    - requires a latency resource record to be set for resource that hosts your app
   - failover
    - active/passive setups
    - auto health-checks, if fails goes to secondary location
   - Geolocation
    - based on geographic location
   - Geoproximity
    - have to use traffic flow to build
    - use regions then create bias/boundaries 
   - Multi-value
    - same as simple, but with health checks
  - Health checks
   - every 30s by default
   - init a failover
   - chains

- eventual consistent reads (default), possible inconsistent, but faster
- strongly consistent reads, consistent, slower
- read capacity units
- write capacity
- items = rows
- attributes collumns
- keys = id
- sort = range
- have to set a primary key, can't be reset 
- only have partition key, internal hash function to decide where data gets partitioned
- should try to divide data evenly
- composite keys (partition and sort key) has to be unique in the comp. still is hashed, but is grouping data closer together
- values = data
- no date type in dynamo
- Partition - allocation of storage for a table, auto-created 
- for every 10GB, when you exceed the RCUs or the WCUS

  - eventually consistent
- Scan
  - through all items, return one or more items through filters
  - returns everything, so can be slow, use a lot of resources
- Provisioned throughput capacity max about of capacity or write per second 
- if you go beyond capacity, it will throw erros
- On-demand capacity, pay per request, good for new tables, unpredictable loads, default limits: 40,000 RCUs/WCUs. can be expensive 
- Calculating reads
  - one strongly consistent read pper second or two eventually consistent reada per seconds for an item 4kb in size
  - strong: round up to 4, divided by 4, times by number of reads
  - eventual: round up to 4, divide by 4, times by number of reads, divide by 2, round to nearest whole number

  - LSI local secondary index (only created with initial table, can't edit it later)
   - scoped to base table partition, has the same partition key value
   - shares provisioned throughput
   - limited to 5 per table 
   - sort should be different
   - can be strongly consistent
  - GSI global secondary index    
   - queries on the index can span all of the data in the base table across all partitions
   - no size rescrtions

    - SSE-KMS
     - management the keys 
    - SSE-C   
     - client key
    - client side
     - you encrypt
    - new objects
     - read after write consistency
     - eventual consistency
    - cross region replication
     - automatically replicated 
     - versioning must be turned on
    - versioning

    - caching HTML fragments 
   - redis
    - not as fast
    - good at leader boards / stuff like that 
   - only accessible in the same VPC
  AWS Lambda
   - run code without provisioning or managing servers
   - only runs when needed
   - cheap
   - serverless
   - scales automatically
   - anything past 15 mins you probs want to use fargate
   - cold starts - has a delay 
   - Versioning
    - manage deployments
    - $LATEST
    - each version has its own ARN
     - qualified has an end
     - unqualifed - no version suffix can't use alias
    -  Alias = friendly name for resources
    -  Layers
     - a way of pulling in additional code and content
     - instead of putting it in your deployment package
     - faster deployment, easier to re use
     - 5 layers per funtion, limit 250mb
  API gateway
   - a solution for creating secure APIs in your cloud environment at any scale
   - create APIs that act as a door to access dta, logic, or backend services
   - handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrect api
   - resources
    - multiple resouces 
    - urls you define
    - can have childern 
   - methods
    - define on on resouces
    - these are rest apis
   -  stages
    - stagea are version of your api  
   -  invoke url
    -  the unique url aws gives you to actually hit the endpoint
   -  deploy api
    - everytime you change it, you must re-deploy
   - configuration
    - most common is lambda
   - caching
    - can be enabled to cache your endpoints responce to calls
    - improves latency / reduce calls
   - CORS
    - cross-origin resource sharing
    - allows restricted resources on a webpage to be requested from a different domain than the resource 
    - always enforced by the client
    - same origin policy
  Step functions
   - state machine 
    - abstract model which decides how one state moves to another based on a series of conditions = flow chart
   - coordinated multiple aws services into a serverless work flow
   - standard
    - most stuff 
   - express 
    - streaming data
    - short duration/high event
   - steps can be executed in parallel
   - JSON to manage states
   - Pass state
    - passes its input to its output without performing any work   
    - parameters
    - result
    - result path
   - Task state
   - represents a single unit of work performed by a state machine
    - lambda function task
    - supported aws service (like batch job)
    - activities - a worker thaqt can be hosted on anywhere (EC2)  
    - choice state - add branching logic to state machine
    - wait state
    - succeed state
    - fail state
    - parallel states - waits for multiple branches to complete before moving on to next state
    - map states
