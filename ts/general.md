# general

- `$""` let's you do operations after (conversations to other types this is object notation)
- ? means an optional param

## Creating interfaces
- also called duck typing
- to use a function we give a call signature = like declaration but only params and return type. Needs both name and type. 
- `class Dog {  
    sound = "barking";  
}  `
